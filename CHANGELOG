## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- Initial public release of **ReleasePilot**
- Assisted orchestration of `yarn` commands for white-label app builds
- Deterministic execution planning matching real execution order
- Interactive selection of platforms, contractors, environments, and commands
- Support for multi-platform builds (`android`, `ios`)
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints between environments and contractors
- Final release summary including project name, git branch, environments, platforms, and executed commands
- ANSI-colored CLI output (purple theme)
- Zero external dependencies (Python standard library only)
- macOS installation via `pipx`

### Philosophy
- Clear separation between orchestration (ReleasePilot) and execution (Yarn)
- No low-level build logic embedded in the orchestrator
- Focus on predictability, auditability, and operational safety
